Service Connect is a Java Spring Bootâ€“based web application that links customers with trusted service providers
 for home service needs. Users can register, log in, create service requests, manage appointments, handle payments via 
a built-in wallet, and track notifications. Service providers can accept jobs, update their availability calendars, and
withdraw earnings after completing tasks. The project uses MySQL for data storage, ensures secure authentication using
session tokens, and includes useful features like service request tracking, audit logging, and basic analytics to monitor 
app usage.
