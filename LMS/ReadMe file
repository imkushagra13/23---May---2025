The Library Management System is a simple Java-based application that helps manage books, members, and lending records efficiently.
It allows librarians to add books, register members, issue and return books, and track overdue loans using a background thread.
The system utilizes exception handling to prevent errors, collections like HashMap and ArrayList for storing data, and generics to create a flexible repository.
Java Streams enable filtering available books, identifying borrowers, and generating overdue book reports, while sorting functions organize books alphabetically.
The multithreading feature ensures overdue books are detected periodically.
Overall, the system demonstrates key Java concepts in a user-friendly way to simplify library operations.
