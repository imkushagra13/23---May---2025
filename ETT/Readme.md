The Employee Task Tracker is a simple program that helps manage tasks assigned to employees.
It allows adding employees, assigning tasks, updating task status, and automatically checking overdue tasks.
The system stores tasks in an organized way, prevents errors, and runs a background process to monitor deadlines.
When started, it displays tasks, lets you search for specific ones, and alerts when tasks are overdue, making tracking
and management easy for everyone.
